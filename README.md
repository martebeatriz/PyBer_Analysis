# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis: 
This analysis consists of a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. As well as a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

### Results: 
According to the analysis by city type, rural cities have about 125 rides occurring while suburban cities have 625 and urban cities have 1,625 rides. The more rides they have, the more drivers. rural, suburban, and urban cities have 78, 490, and 2,405 total drivers respectively. These numbers correspond with the total amount of fares collected. The more rides and drivers, the more fares were collected. 

However, those numbers do not continue in the upward trend when related to average fare per ride and average fare per deriver. The more rides and drivers, the less the average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

The multi-line graph also sustains these findings and outlines them by month. It showed that the fares are pretty consistent by city type. No city type overperforms or underperforms any other.

### Summary: 
Based on these results, I suggest that more drivers be added to rural and suburban areas in order to lower the fare cost to the lower levels seen in urban areas where there are more drivers, more fares, and lower fare costs per ride.
